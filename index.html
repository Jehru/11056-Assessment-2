        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building. </p>
        
        <p>Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed.</p>

        <p>Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key features of the brutalist style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style: Cameron Offices, National Gallery of Australia and High Court of Australia.</p>

        <h2>Statement of Signifiance</h2>
        <p>Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as follows:</p> 
        
            <ul>
                <li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
                <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style including: sloping structural fins, precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows.</p>
            
<!-- maybe change the including list into a horizontal one for easier to read 
            <ul>
                <li>sloping structural fins</li>
                <li>precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels</li>
                <li>precast fins for sun protection</li>
                <li>vertical slit windows</li>
            </ul> -->    

        <p>Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style, and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the intended office use.</p>
        
        <p>The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles.</p>
        
        <p>Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.</p>
